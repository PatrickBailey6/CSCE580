In this Instructable, learn how to make a super easy homemade no-bake pumpkin pie filling or dip. It can be used for a no-bake pumpkin pie, or to fill cream puffs, eclairs, or donuts, used as a dip with cookies, or served as is in a bowl topped with whipped cream. It is so good and comes together in less than 10 minutes. It is perfect for any Fall, Halloween, or Holiday party where you want something pumpkin-related.

Supplies

Ingredients:

    8 oz of cream cheese, softened (226g)
    1 tsp of vanilla extract (5g)
    1 cup of canned pure pumpkin or use homemade (245g)
    1 8-oz tub of whipped topping (226g)
    1/2 tsp of cinnamon (1g)
    1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (1g)
    1 cup of powdered sugar (110g)

Equipment/Tools

    1 large bowl
    Mixer
    Spatula

Step 1: Mix Everything

This couldn't be any easier; just add all the ingredients to a large bowl and mix until well combined and smooth.

NOTE: If your cream cheese isn't quite soft enough, you will probably get small chunks of cream cheese sprinkled throughout the dessert. Don't worry, it will still taste really good, but just won't be as smooth as it could have been. Soften the cream cheese in the microwave or take it out of the fridge a few hours before you plan to use it.
Step 2: Serve It!

Now use it however you want! One of my favorite ways to eat it is as is in a bowl with whipped cream on top and cinnamon. But it makes an amazing filling for a no-bake pumpkin pie or pastry cream filling, or a Fall dip for cookies.
