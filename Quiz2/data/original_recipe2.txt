A savory, rich flavor of cottage cheese and cheese. The green onion only slightly complements the flavor, has no bitterness at all, and adds its own special touch. I prefer it for breakfast, but it’s delicious at any time of the day.

In our projects, all dishes are prepared by my 9-year-old daughter.

If you’d like to see all the steps with the ingredients in more detail, here’s the video from our channel: 👉https://youtu.be/f44GWPEu8us. The video is in Russian, but don’t worry — there’s not much speech, and the cooking process doesn’t really need translation, right? 😉
Supplies

Milk – 100 ml (about ⅓ cup + 1 tsp)

Green onion – 30 g (about ⅓ cup chopped)

Cottage cheese – 250 g (about 1 cup)

Grated cheese (Parmesan works well, but you can also use other hard cheeses) – 200 g (about 2 cups)

Salt – ¼ tsp

Eggs – 2

Flour – 90 g (about ¾ cup)

Sunflower oil (or olive oil) – one tablespoon
Step 1:

Chop the green onion.
Step 2:

In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients: milk, green onion, eggs, salt, flour, cheese, and cottage cheese. Mix until smooth and well combined.
Step 3:

Pour a small amount of sunflower oil (or olive oil) into a frying pan. Use a paper towel to spread it, making the oil layer as thin as possible.
Step 4:

Place the frying pan over medium heat and pour the mixture into the pan. Spread it evenly with a spatula and cover with a lid.
Step 5:

Cook over the heat for about 7 minutes — you’ll see that the edge of the flatbread touching the pan has browned, and the top has become slightly yellow.
Step 6:

Make sure the flatbread isn’t sticking to the pan. You can gently shake the pan to check. If the flatbread moves and jiggles, you can move on to the next step. If it’s sticking, carefully loosen it with a spatula.
Step 7:

Next, we have a little cooking trick. But don’t worry! My 9-year-old daughter managed it perfectly on her first try! So gather your courage and let’s go :)

Take a plate.The plate should be roughly the same size as the flatbread. Place the plate on top of the flatbread and carefully flip the pan, holding the plate. Act quickly, as the plate will start to heat up!

Use a spatula to return the flatbread to the pan, placing the uncooked side down (the photos will help guide you).

Then, cover with the lid, turn the heat to the lowest setting, and cook for another 5–7 minutes.
Step 8:

Now it’s time to remove the flatbread. You can use a plate again, but we used a cutting board — this way, you can cut and serve it immediately. Place the board on top of the pan and do the same as in step 7 — flip the pan so that the flatbread ends up on the board.

Here’s what we got! By the way, the aroma is absolutely amazing! Good luck with cooking. I know step 7 might take some courage, but I’m sure you’ll manage! Let my daughter’s experience inspire and encourage you!
