### Quiz 2

## Question 1

# Generate Images Tool

* Employing a local AI on your device and batching models will lower energy usage to 0.3Wh per image versus the 2.9 Wh per image on a large cloud AI.

# Translation

* Using a basic translator, like google translate, is a strong alternative, again at 0.3 Wh per query from 2.9 Wh. Lowering your model size will also save 0.6 Wh per query.

# Math Solving

* Using a calculator app for arithmetic has significatly higher energy efficiency, down to 0.01Wh per calculation. An AI math solver will, however, be able to process complex reasoning and explainations.

# Part B

* The average across the three settings was about 2.33 Wh per specific use. The classical approach to every setting was on average was 80% more energy efficient than the LLM modeling.

## Question 2

# Cleaning

* Image alternate text was removed from the test.

# Full Prompt
